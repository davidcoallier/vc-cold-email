## Example 1 — Dev tools, second-time founder with notable exits

**What makes it work**: The team signal leads immediately (second-time founder, big-name employers). The product is explained in one sentence. Clear ask with deck attached.

```
Subject: Archetype | API monetisation for devs | 2x founder · Seed

Hi [Name],

You've backed several developer tools companies — Archetype is 
squarely in that space.

I'm a second-time founder (acquired) and engineer, previously at 
LinkedIn, Dialpad, and Lantern. My team built Archetype 
(archetype.dev), which lets developers and companies publish and 
monetise APIs in minutes.

We're pre-revenue but have strong early developer adoption and 
inbound from three enterprise prospects. Raising a seed round.

Would you have 20 minutes to explore fit?

Best,
[Name]
```

**Why it works**: Team signal (2x founder, tier-1 employers) compensates for pre-revenue stage. Personalised hook is genuine. Under 100 words.

## Example 2 — B2B SaaS middleware, 3x founder with pilot traction

**What makes it work**: Three strong signals stacked: serial founder, existing pilot at scale (1M customers), and institutional backing (Antler). Round terms are explicit.

```
Subject: [Company] | B2B SaaS middleware | 3x founder, 1M customers · Seed

Hi [Name],

I understand you're looking for teams at the intersection of 
behavioural change and B2B SaaS — that's exactly where we operate.

I'm a 3x founder with a signed pilot reaching 1M customers. We've 
built a platform that makes it 10x faster to launch third-party 
integrations into the B2B tools enterprises use daily — cutting 
time-to-integration from months to days.

Backed by Antler VC. Raising AU$600k on a SAFE at $4M cap, 
20% discount.

Open to a call?

```

**Why it works**: Thesis fit hook is specific (references the investor's own stated thesis). Three credible signals. Round terms are completely clear.

## Example 3 — Emerging market fintech, early but compelling signals

**What makes it work**: Niche market with a specific TAM, early but concrete validation (100 units sold, 90% repayment), and named partnerships. Honest about stage.

```
Subject: [Company] | Motorcycle financing, Kenya | 90% repayment · Pre-seed

Hi [Name],

Your focus on emerging market financial inclusion caught my eye.

We help motorcycle ride-hailing drivers in Kenya access smartphone 
financing — the entry point to a super app for Africa's 1M+ boda 
boda drivers, an $80B market.

Early results: 100 smartphones sold, 90% repayment rate, 10,000 
drivers on the waitlist. Partnerships signed with Lami Insurance, 
ongoing discussions with Bolt Africa and Uber Africa.

Raising a pre-seed round to scale supply and add services.

Happy to share our deck — 20 minutes?

```

**Why it works**: Specific market size, early but credible numbers, named partners. Honest about stage. Concise.
