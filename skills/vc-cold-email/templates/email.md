**Fintech VC:**
> "I saw you backed [portfolio company] — you clearly understand the opportunity in underserved SME segments, and tradespeople are one of the biggest gaps legacy fintech has failed to close."

**Future of Work / SME tools VC:**
> "Your thesis on distribution moats in SME software caught my eye — WhatsApp as a native delivery channel is the most powerful distribution moat we've seen in this segment."

**European / Irish VC:**
> "You've been active in Irish fintech — Manano is built here and our model is designed for European rollout, with VAT compliance and invoicing standards already multi-market-ready."

**B2B SaaS VC:**
